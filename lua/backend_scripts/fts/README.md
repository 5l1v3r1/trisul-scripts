FTS Stream Scripts
==================

FTS are Full Text Document streams generated by the Trisul Fast Path and made available to you in the Slow Path (called Backend scripts).

The documentation for samples in the 'fts' dir are at [FTS Monitor Docs](http://trisul.org/docs/lua/fts_monitor.html) . 

The built in FTS Documents are 

1. HTTP Headers 
2. SSL Certificates 
3. DNS Records


The main 'trick' to write effective Trisul LUA scripts on the FTS stream is two fold

1. Identify the  structure of the documents 
2. Use a Regex or someother method to capture what you want

To identify the structure of a document, you can either use the Web Trisul UI under Resources > FTS or you can write a simple
script to dump the document on screen.


Samples
-------

The sample scripts here demonstrate the approach.


Note
----

All FTS Scripts work only if you have the corresponding FTS type enabled in trisulProbeConfig.xml

The config file is usually found in `/usr/local/etc/trisul-probe/domain0/probe0/context0/trisulProbeConfig.xml`
