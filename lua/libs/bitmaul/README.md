BITMAUL is a LUA helper library that makes it easy to 

*  Perform packet dissection with support for most common idioms in network protocols
*  Handle PDU reassembly on top of a TCP stream 


There are two libs you can use independently. 

1. pdurecord : constructs TCP PDUs from bytestream 
2. sweepbuf : break up bytes into protocol fields
