Print counter group info 
========================


Trisul metering infrastructure is based on counter groups.
Each counter group contains a number of "meters"
Each counter group monitors a number of "keys" each of them
having the same set of "meters".

The COUNTER_GROUP_INFO TRP request can be used to get details of 
any counter group via scripting. 


There are two scripts here.

1. cginfo.rb : Print details of a SINGLE counter group
2. cginfoall.rb : Details of ALL counter groups on Trisul
