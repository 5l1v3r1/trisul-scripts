Active keys in a range
======================

The KEYSPACE_REQUEST command is used to retrieve the active keys in a range.

This request can be used to retrieve all IPs seen in the 10.x.x.x private IP range.

This directory has two scripts

1. active_keys.rb - Print all active keys in Trisul Key Format 
2. active_keys2.rb - Print all readable resolved keys, uses an additional message called KeyLookup 


### TRP Messages used

The above script uses the following TRP Messages

1. [KeySpace](http://trisul.org/docs/ref/trpprotomessages.html#keyspace)  - to retrieve keys in a range 



### Sample run


The following run displays the all Ports  seen in the range p-0000 to p-1000. In Trisul key format
this equate port 0 to port 4096 

Note that "Hosts" counter group has the GUID {C-4CD...} and the keys are in Trisul Key Format.

The active_keys2.rb script extends the base script to convert human readable keys into Trisul Key Format. We've separated the two scripts to highlight use of the KeySpace message.
