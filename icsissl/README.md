Verify certs against the ICSI Certificate Notary
================================================

Trisul 3.0 sample script to check all your SSL Certs in the 
past 24 hours against the ICSI Certificate notary.


The ICSI Certificate Notary http://notary.icsi.berkeley.edu
maintains a list of certificates it has seen based on passive
observation from a number of vantage points. They maintain 
a public DNS service where you can send a query to check if
a certificate you have seen has also been seen and validated 
by them.

"When clients encounter a certificate, they can match it against 
the notaryâ€™s version and flag mismatches as possible attacks."


Trisul 3.0 SSL Certificate Resources
------------------------------------

Trisul has always tracked and stored Domain Names and HTTP URLs. From 
R 3.0 it also stores certificate chains. It stores a SHA1 hash of the
DER encoded certificate and also the Subject Name in canonical format.

For example a chain looks like this

````
SHA1:eaac4d85de68a084f5ea7872c2a6b9761e31078e
NAME:/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=IT/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=09339391006/C=IT/postalCode=00187/ST=Italia/L=Roma/street=Via Veneto, 119/O=Banca Nazionale del Lavoro S.p.A./OU=server1/CN=banking.secure.bnl.it
---
SHA1:b18039899831f152614667cf23ffcea2b0e73dab
NAME:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=Terms of use at https://www.verisign.com/rpa (c)06/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Extended Validation SSL SGC CA
---
SHA1:32f30882622b87cf8856c63db873df0853b4dd27
NAME:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=(c) 2006 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5
---
SHA1:742c3192e607e424eb4549542be1bbc53e6174e2
NAME:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority
---

````

1. Each certificate in chain is separated by a '---' string 
2. You can just check the top certificate or the entire chain. 


The ruby script checknotary.rb
------------------------------------

Note : You also need the dnsruby gem. ( sudo gem install dnsruby  )

The script is quite straightforward.

1. Connects to a Trisul Probe at a given IP Address
2. Sends a TRP Resource Group Request to retreive all SSL Resources (new in 3.0)
3. FOr each resource, which is actually a chain of certificates, extract each cert
4. For each cert, use the SHA1 to send a DNS txt query to {sha1}.notary.icsi.berkeley.edu
5. If you get a NXDOMAIN response - log the offending cert & print subject name
6. If you get a TXT response, check for validated=1 and print subject name if not 
7. We use a caching scheme so we dont check the same cert twice 


Sample output 
-------------

Before running make sure you have the TRP client cert and private key in your running directory.

Some of the validation failures maybe due to the fact that we are checking root CAs also. You can modify the code as you please to only check the servers certificate.
